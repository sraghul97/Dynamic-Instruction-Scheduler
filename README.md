# Dynamic-Instruction-Scheduler


1. Developed a super-scalar simulator for an out-of-order (OOO) processor, featuring multiple instruction fetching per cycle.
2. Implemented with a Rename Table (RMT), Reorder Buffer (ROB), and Issue Queue (IQ).
3. Evaluated the impact of parameters like super-scalar width, issue queue size, and re-order buffer on IPC.
